This project is part of The Odin Project's online curriculum. The idea of the project is simple, to create an online calculator that behaves as one would expect a normal calculator to. 

I will start by getting basic functions and the display built and then will tweak by adding style and additional functionality.

This project was a challenge. I did habe to rely on some other students solutions. Special credit to rueeazy! Using css html and js I was able to get this up and running and styled to the point that I felt good about it.
